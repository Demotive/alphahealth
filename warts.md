##Warts often go away on their own
You don’t have to do anything about warts. They’ll usually disappear within 2 years.

Warts don’t cause you any harm. Sometimes warts can itch or bleed but that doesn’t mean there’s a problem.

<div class="notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
  <p>
    There’s no need to see your GP unless your warts are in a spot that’s bothering you, keep coming back or they’re painful.
  </p>
</div>

Don’t try to scrape off your warts and verrucas. You might get more.

You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from the pharmacy to remove warts. However, these treatments can be painful and don’t always work.

[Warts on your vulva, penis or anus](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genital_warts/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (genital warts) need different treatment.

##Removing warts from your face, hands or other visible spots
Warts on your face: see your GP - they might refer you to a skin specialist.  
Don’t use wart removal creams, plasters and sprays on your face.

Warts in other visible spots, eg your hands: your GP might freeze them off. They will become inflamed, then settle and then fall off a few weeks later. If the wart is big you might need several sessions. However, the warts can come back.

##How to stop warts from spreading

- wash your hands after touching a wart
- don’t bite your nails or suck your fingers with warts on
- change your socks daily if you have warts on your feet
- avoid cutting warts when shaving
- don’t share towels
- cover warts when swimming
