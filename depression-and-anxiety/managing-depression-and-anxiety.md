#Managing depression and anxiety
 
There is lots of support out there to help you manage your depression or anxiety.

##Talking to people who know what it’s like
Being open and talking to people who’re dealing with MMAD can help with:
 
- shifting your focus to positive things that happened
- making things look less black and white
- not jumping to negative conclusions
- not labelling yourself badly
 
Your GP might be able to refer to:
 
- local befriending groups - meet a trained volunteer and do something enjoyable together
- peer support worker - someone with MMAD who can help you access services such as

##Keeping active
20 minutes of exercise a day can help with your depression or anxiety.
 
Exercise releases a chemical in your brain called endorphins which lifts your mood.
 
Ask your GP for a prescription for exercise. This will refer you to a local gym without any cost to you.
 
If the gym isn’t for you, there are other options.  

###Anything can be exercise
 
Exercise can be anything that gets you slightly out of breath, for example:
 
- walking, for example part or all the way to work
- housework
- gardening - [find a gardening project in your area](http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/ecotherapy/finding-a-programme/#.VmAbeNDquU4) or work outside with [Green Gym](http://www.tcv.org.uk/greengym)
 
Just being active in any way for 20 minutes a day can help lift your mood.

##Keeping in touch with people
Socialising can help you keeping active and grounded.

Keeping in touch with people can feel difficult when you feel depressed or anxious but facing your fears is an important part of managing your condition on a daily basis. 

Try to talk to friends and family regularly and meet up with them whenever possible. 

[Volunteering](https://www.gov.uk/government/get-involved/take-part/volunteer) can also be a good way to meet people while helping others. 

##Stop and notice things
When we’re busy and stressed we often develop a ‘tunnel vision’ and rush through life. But the way we think is very important to the way we feel. 

Every day just take a moment to stand back and observe: 

- what you’re thinking
- how you’re feeling 
- what’s happening around you

Just notice these things without doing anything further. 

This is called 'mindfulness'. It can help you notice signs of stress, anxiety or depression earlier and deal with them better.
  
Things like yoga and meditation can also help you being more aware. 
 
##Eating
 
When your body is healthy, you’ll feel physically better and also feel better about yourself. 
 
Try to eat regular meals and drink lots of fluids (at least a litre a day). Dehydration can affect your mood
 
### Eat fruit and vegetables every day
 
Especially ones rich in vitamins:
 
- apricots, melon, peaches
- broccoli, carrots, cabbage, pumpkin, spinach, sweet potato
- nuts and seeds
 
### Eat some starchy foods
 
Things like:
 
- rice, pasta
- bread

### Regularly eat foods with lots of protein
 
Things like:
 
- chicken, lean beef, turkey
- tuna
- beans, peas
- low-fat cheese, soya products, yoghurt
 
##Be careful with drinking alcohol
Try not to drink too much alcohol. Men should not have more than 3 to 4 units a day, women 2 to 3 units.
 
3 units is about one pint of beer or a large glass of wine.
