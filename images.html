      <p>Many people have type 2 diabetes and don’t realise. This is because the symptoms develop slowly and don’t necessarily make you feel unwell.  People are often diagnosed with diabetes when they go to their GP with another problem.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-have-type-2-diabetes">How to tell if you have type 2 diabetes</h2>

      <p>Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>peeing more than usual, particularly at night</li>
        <li>feeling thirsty all the time</li>
        <li>feeling very tired</li>
        <li>losing weight without trying</li>
        <li>itching around your penis or vagina, or you keep getting thrush</li>
        <li>cuts or wounds that take longer to heal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="when-to-see-your-gp">When to see your GP</h2>
      <p>See your GP if you have any of the symptoms of diabetes, or you are worried you may have a higher risk of developing it.</p>

      <p><a href="/type-2-diabetes/getting-diagnosed">Your GP can diagnose diabetes</a>. You’ll need a blood test which you may have to go to your local health center for if it can’t be done at your GP surgery.</p>

      <p>The earlier diabetes is diagnosed and treatment starts, the better. Treating diabetes early reduces your risk of <a href="/type-2-diabetes/health-problems">other health problems</a>.</p>
